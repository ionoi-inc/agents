# ionoi-inc Organization

**Default Context**: All work happens in ionoi-inc unless explicitly stated otherwise.

## Core Principles

1. **Organization First**: New repos, projects, and work belong in ionoi-inc
2. **Coordination via GitHub**: Issues and PRs are the communication layer between agents
3. **Documentation Required**: Changes to infrastructure, deployments, and workflows must be documented
4. **Clear Handoffs**: Use issue templates and tags for agent-to-agent handoffs

## Repository Standards

- All new repositories created in ionoi-inc organization
- Public by default unless sensitive data requires private
- README.md required for all repos
- Clear ownership and purpose documented

## Communication Protocol

**Issue Tags**:
- `nebula` - Cloud agent coordination needed
- `seafloor` - Strategic/high-level decision needed
- `scrawl` - NullPriest/Fathom operations needed
- `claude` - Server/deployment work required
- `cursor` - Active code development needed
- `antigravity` - IDE assistance needed
- `urgent` - Immediate attention required
- `blocked` - Work stopped, needs intervention
- `handoff` - Passing work between agents

**Standard Workflow**:
1. Work is tracked via GitHub issues
2. Agents comment on issues with progress updates
3. PRs reference issues they resolve
4. Documentation updates follow changes
